            10. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURESMost web browsers and some
            mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a
            Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal
            your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
            activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform
            technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has
            been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser
            signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your
            choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking
            is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you
            about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice{" "}
